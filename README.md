FEEL FREE TO COPY THIS PROJECT!
It was just for fun tbh. Plus, I got a little more experience using the system clock.
To run this program, download the folder.
Then, cd into the project folder ("ls" should give you run.java and a few other files) and run "javac run.java" and then run "run java"
If you are running this between 11-16-2023 and 12-13-2023, it should work like normal.
If not, follow the suggestion at the bottom of the printed output to get an idea of what it looks like.
  Simply run "java run yyyy-mm-dd" using values within the timeframe I mentioned above after doing "javac run.java" and it should print the message for that day!
